### About the project
This website is made with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) as the project framework, [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for the front-end styling, Highcharts and Google Maps for displaying data, and the Yelp and Zomato APIs for gathering data.

### About me
I'm an engineering student at the Universitiy of Virginia studying computer science. I enjoy casually making personal projects because I think they're a fun way to learn new skills — check out my other repositories for some of my favorite projects.

### Possible extensions
- Use a backend (maybe with Node.js) to allow more data processing and to utilize advanced API functionality
- Implement Twitter API to see tweets about a location and restaurant
- Use Yelp's menu data to display the restaurant menu
- Add a word frequency chart to show popular words found in restaurant reviews
- Try replacing Vue another web framework like Angular or React

*Note: To run this website locally, edit the ```.env``` file and add the required API credentials.*
